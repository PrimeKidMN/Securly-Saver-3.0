Welcome to securly be gone made by PrimeKidMN.

How to unblock everything:

To start there are a few things you will for sure need to get
1. A user agent switcher extension a good one is this: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/agentium-user-agent-switc/kabejgcoafnliefbhejpfahdecimjcje
2. Click the extension and press create new user agent.
3. Paste this in were it says user agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS aarch64 13099.85.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.110 Safari/537.36
4. Click the on button and your set up!

What we just did is called user agent switching basically we downgraded to a version of chrome old enough that securly no longer works.
