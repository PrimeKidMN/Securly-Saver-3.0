Welcome to securly be gone made by PrimeKidMN.

How to unblock everything:

To start there are a few things you will for sure need to get
1. A user agent switcher extension a good one is this: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/user-agent-switcher-depre/iojaoainolpgkpojokmeclhidjolocci

2. Click the extension and press create new user agent.

3. Paste this in were it says user agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; CrOS aarch64 13099.85.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/84.0.4147.110 Safari/537.36

4. Click the on button and your set up!

What we just did is called user agent switching basically your agent is your browsers tech stack I guess you could say. It has your web browser model, stats, and architecture type in it. Your web identity, when we swap it we are down grading your web identity so that securly thinks you are on an unsupported version of chrome and stops functioning. It will not remove your search history dont go to that website I know your trying to go to, dont be dumb.

{DISCLAIMER!!!!}
 In chrome://policy

check the name called "ExtensionInstallBlocklist", if the value of it is ["*"]

If it is set to that this will break your extensions!.
